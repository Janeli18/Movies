<p><h1> SERIES OVERVIEW</p></h1>

<p><h3> The Originals, a spin-off from The Vampire Diaries, centers on three of the Mikaelson siblings: Klaus <a href="http://wikipedia.com//Joseph Moragn"> (Joseph Morgan)</a>, Elijah (Daniel Gillies), and Rebekah (Claire Holt). 
The Mikaelson family is called "the Originals" as they are the first vampires to ever exist. 
Niklaus "Klaus" Mikaelson is a descendant of a witch and a werewolf, and his quest to unleash his hybrid nature was detailed in The Vampire Diaries. 
The backdoor pilot, which aired on April 25, 2013, also revealed that the werewolf Hayley <a href="http://wikipedia.com//Phoebe Tonkin">
(Phoebe Tonkin)</a> is pregnant with Klaus's child.
 The series begins with the Original siblings returning to the city of New Orleans for the first time since 1919, where a pregnant Hayley has also settled. Having originally built the city, they had been forced to abandon it when fleeing from their vengeful father. 
 In their absence, Klaus's protégé, Marcel <a href="http://wikipedia.com//Charles Michael Davis">(Charles Michael Davis)</a>, took charge of the city. Klaus resolves that they must take down Marcel and get back the city that once belonged to them.
 While doing that they must also protect their city from a war brewing between vampires, werewolves, and witches.
 Over time, new and old friendships are formed, love is in the air, death surrounds them, and the Originals learn more about their own family past.
 The first season describes how Klaus's mystical child is going to be born and speaks of the threats that the Originals together must keep her safe from. 
 The second season deals with the return of Klaus and his siblings' parents, and the arrival of an aunt who threatens the baby's life.
 The third season shows the Mikaelsons facing both a prophecy that speaks of their downfall, and the first-sired vampires who have wanted revenge for a millennium.
 The fourth season jumps ahead five years, with the Mikaelsons returning to New Orleans and having to face a reawakened ancient menace set on destroying anything in its path. 
 The fifth and final season of the series takes place seven years after the fourth season, with Hope now being a teenager at a school for supernatural children, the Salvatore Boarding School for the Young and Gifted.</p></h3>
